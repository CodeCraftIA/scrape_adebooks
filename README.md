# scrape_adebooks
This project consists of three web scraping scripts that extract data from AbeBooks and other websites. Each script is designed to handle different tasks: extracting book information, finding specific URLs, and identifying prices within certain ranges. The data is processed and saved into various output files for further analysis.
